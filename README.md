# EDA & Power BI Dashboard Project

## 📁 Project Overview  
This repository contains our team’s collaborative project for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the creation of a **Power BI Dashboard**.  
We are working together to clean, analyze, and visualize the data for actionable insights.

## 🎯 Project Workflow  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Raw data stored in `OG-Data` folder.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned datasets stored in `cleaned-Data` folder.  
   - Removal of duplicates, handling missing values, formatting corrections, etc.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the dataset through statistics, visualizations, and feature exploration.  

4. **Final Deliverable**  
   - **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** summarizing key findings and insights from the analysis.
